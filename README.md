# Coq website
This repository contains the static pages of the Coq website

    make
    make run

Pre-html sources are in `pages/` and `news/`, while final html files
will be assembled in `dest/`.

Note that links may not work locally, and pages will have to have `.html` appended to the URL in order to view them.

## Prerequisites
The html files are pre-processed by [Yamlpp](http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/yamlpp.en.html). A copy of
yamlpp is included in this repository, we simply need an OCaml
toplevel to run it as a script. If you further modify the source
file `yamlpp.mll` to customize the pre-processing, you will also need
`ocamllex` to regenerate `yamlpp.ml`.

## How to edit an existing page?
* Edit the source file containing the webpage.
* Run `make` and check that the produced file is ok.
   If that may help, `make run` launches a small local webserver
* Commit your change and push it to the main repository
   The update of [coq.inria.fr](https://coq.inria.fr/) should then be automatic (TODO)

## How to create a new page?
* Add your new file in `pages/`. File name is up to you, but please
  avoid strange ones. Files in `pages/` will be pre-processed by Yamlpp
  (see `yamlpp-*/README` for me details). Basically, to be uniform with
  the other pages of the site, your file should look like:

      <#def TITLE> your page title </#def>
      <#include "incl/header.html">

  with your HTML code corresponding roughly to the inner of the HTML body:

      <#include "incl/footer.html">

   In addition, you could add just after the TITLE two other macro definitions:
   * HEAD : anything in it will be added at the end of the `<head>` section
   * PATH : some code displayed before the title of your page, usually
     a sequence of links to your page ancestors. See Drupal's breadcrumb.
     By default: `<a href="/">Home</a>`.

* Ensure that your page is built and installed. Normally, this should be
   automatic now.
   You could add multiple lines to have multiple aliases for the same page.

   Nota: for pages converted from Drupal, the relevant part of the url is
   now a directory, in with we place an index.html. This approach is also
   recommended for new pages, but not mandatory.

* make, verify, commit, push as for the edition of an existing page below.

## And for news?
* Add a new file in `news/` with the file name of your liking.
   You can for instance copy `news/template` and adapt it, or any existing
   news files. See `news/template` for details about the expected syntax.

* In the file `NEWSINDEX`, add your news title (filename) at the top
   (this list is sorted in chronological order, most recent first).

* make, verify, commit, push as usual
