<div class="frameworklabel">Sustaining the evolution of Coq while giving a voice to stakeholders</div>
<div class="frameworkcontent">

<p>For many years, the development of Coq has been supported and
funded almost exclusively by French academic institutions, most
notably Inria. But today, there are intensive Coq users, and thus
major stakeholders, in universities and companies all over the
world.</p>

<p>The objective of the Consortium is to empower this community of
users, whose research and development critically rely on the Coq
system.  For these users, making sure that the system's maintenance is
well funded is essential.  They can do so by providing resources
either as donations, Consortium membership or support service
subscriptions.  Furthermore, Consortium members and support service
subscribers get a voice in the evolution of Coq, by determining where
some engineering resources are allocated.</p>

<p>To summarize, on the one hand, we wish to
establish <strong>transparent ways of contributing financially and
technically</strong> to the development of the system; on the other
hand we wish to make sure that the <strong>most pressing needs of
major stakeholders are addressed efficiently</strong> by providing a
fantastic working environment to competent Coq developers.</p>

<p>The Coq Consortium is hosted by Inria (the French national institute for
research in digital science and technology), the premier actor behind
the development of Coq.</p>

<div class="frameworklabel">Membership</div>
<div class="frameworkcontent">
  <p>The Coq Consortium comprises the following levels of Membership, depending
on a yearly financial contribution:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold membership: 20k€</li>
      <li>Platinum membership: 50k€</li>
    </ul>

  <p>This contribution supports the development of Coq, on priorities defined by
the Consortium assembly. Gold members get one vote for each ballot at the
assembly, Platinum members get three votes.</p>

  <p>If you wish to join the Coq Consortium as a member, please <a href="mailto:coq-consortium-contact@inria.fr">contact us</a>.

<div class="frameworklabel">Support services</div>
<div class="frameworkcontent">
    <p>Partners can subscribe a package of support services:
        <ul>
            <li>Premium support for bugs. Reports will be
            processed in priority by the Consortium engineers. </li>
            <li>Integration of client code in regression tests.</li>
            <li>Privileged access to Coq developers via a dedicated mailing list.</li>
            <li>Advertisement of the partner’s involvement in the Coq community.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Partners declare a number of intensive users of Coq they represent, and the Consortium recommends a corresponding level of
        service (a number of engineer hours, which can be used for support or training). The cost corresponds to that specific level of service.</p>
